    "## Conclusion\n",
    "We are able to consistently achieve higher true positive rate by vectorizing the question/answer pairs generated from this email dataset compared to vectorizing the raw emails, as indicated by `qa_distance` being consistently lower than `email_distance` for questions where the answer was present in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for queries that were either not present in the data set (\"What were the two most exciting events of 2023\"), or completely nonsensical (\"How many legs does the city of San Francisco have?\"), converting documents to question/answer pairs before vectorizing tends to yield more false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "For use cases where users are expected to **ask questions** rather than provide instructions to a LLM, converting source documents into question and answer pairs is likely to result in more reliable results when performing vector retrieval. For example, this preprocessing technique is likely better suited for customer support or knowledge base search use cases, and less well suited for agent-based workflows."
